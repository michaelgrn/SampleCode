# Machine Learning

This folder contains two examples of Machine Learning code that I have written. All of this code is written in Python 3 using Jupyter Notebook. 

MLHW2 is a homework assignment where we have to write a Logistic Regression Gradient Ascent algorithm by hand, and then using SciKit learn, explore how different C values affect linear regression classification on the iris dataset.

MLHW4 is a homework assignment where we write AdaBoost using the SciKitLearn Linear Regression classifier, and then compare the results of AdaBoost to that of a simple Linear Regression classifier. We then further examine clustering using DBscan and K-Means clustering, demonstrating basic understanding of these algorithms.
