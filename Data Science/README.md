# Data Science

The code in this section focuses on data science, which can include elements from other fields of study such as Machine Learning. All code is written in Python 3 with Jupyter Notebooks employed as the IDE.

***A5*** is an example of feature extraction, selection, data preparation, data description, evaluation of classification performed on the Small Business Adminstration dataset. Since one of the files used in the program was too big to include, it will be necessary to download 

"SBAnational.csv" 

from 

https://www.kaggle.com/mirbektoktogaraev/should-this-loan-be-approved-or-denied 

and move the .csv into the A5 folder in order to rerun the code.

***A6*** is an example of text classification and clustering; with a detailed analysis of both those processes.
