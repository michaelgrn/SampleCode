# Natural Language Processing

All code is this directory are examples of code that focus on Natural Language Processing. The code is written in Python 3 using Jupyter Notebook.

***NLP1*** contains hand written Hidden Markov Models, the first being a greedy algorithm, the second being viterbi.

***NLP2*** contains code intended to create a grammar from several sentences of a made up language; who's efficacy is then tested on further input.

***NLP3*** is an example of machine translation from English to German using deep learning and evaluated with the BLEU metric.

***NLPProject*** is a collaborative effort between Mucun Tian and I, employing deep learning models to generate text. This text is then simplified using text simplification techniques, and tested using readability metrics.
