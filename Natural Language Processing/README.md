# Natural Language Processing

All code is this directory are examples of code that focus on Natural Language Processing. The code is written in Python 3 using Jupyter Notebook.

***A3*** contains hand written Hidden Markov Models, the first being a greedy algorithm, the second being viterbi.

***A4*** contains code that creates a grammar from several sentences of a made up language, then tests that grammar on new input.

***A8*** is an example of machine translation using keras.

***Project*** is a collaborative effort between Mucun Tian and I, where we use deep learning models to generate text which we then perform text simplification on.
