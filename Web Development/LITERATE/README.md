## My Contributions

My main Responsibilites for the LITERATE app was implementating a logging system, troubleshooting/updating the UI, and resolving previous bugs with API calls. This code can be found in literate-app/js/postgres.factory.js (for logging),  /literate-app/routes/index.js (logging and cookie writing code), and /literate-app/views/search.vue (code for logging). I further created a database to store this logging information, the schema seen in /database-creation.
