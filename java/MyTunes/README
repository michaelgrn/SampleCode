Overview: This is a .wav player with a wide range of functionality. It has three different views view a tabbed pane approach,
Max, mid, and min. Keeps track of the number of times each of the songs is played and implements a heat map in the max view.
Will go into the usage of each button later on in the README.

Compilation:

Make sure all the files and folders are in the same folder before compiling the MyTunesDriver.java like:

javac MyTunesDriver.java

Then run the program by typing:

Also this program can be run in an IDE by ensuring all the folders and files are in the same folder and MyTunesDriver.java is compiled/ran.
