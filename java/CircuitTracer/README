CircuitTracer

Overview: This program is a maze searcher algorithm that is meant to find the shortest path between point 1 and point 2.
Input is taken from the console, allowing the user to declare what file to be used, what form of storage should be used,
(stack or queue) and whether to have the output to the console or to a GUI. Includes a variety of exception handling.


Included Files:

CircuitBoard.java - Class which resembles a CircuitBoard, allowing various operations to be run on it
CircuitTracer.java - The driver class, takes in arguments from the console and performs a maze search on them
CTPanel.java - The GUI
InvalidFileFormatException.java - Class that handles Invalid File Format
OccupiedPositionException.java - Class that handles Occupied Positions Exceptions
Storage.Java - Allows the user to choose between queue and stack
TraceState.java - Class that is used and instantiated with each step of the maze search. Repeatedly iterated to find paths.
TestFiles - A folder full of valid and invalid files to use with the Circuit Tracer


Compilation:

In console you must first compile CircuitTracer.java like

javac CircuitTracer.java

Once it is compiled you have to call CircuitTracer using this format

First argugment: -s for stack or -q for queue
Second argument: -c for console output or -g for GUI output
Third argument: input file name 

For example

java CircuitTracer -s -c TestFiles/circuit1.dat
java CircuitTracer -q -g TestFiles/circuit2.dat
