List Tester

Overview: The point of this project was to write a doubly-linked list from the ground up and then implement a test suite in 
order to test all the various permutations of the list, as well as the list iterator. Program tests each method for every variation
of the doubly-linked list.

Files included:

IUDoubleLinkedList.java - Class created from the IndexUnsortedList interface, implemented as a doubly-linked list
IndexUnsortedList.java - Interface used to create the IUDoubleLinkedList
LinearNode.java - Nodes that compromise the IUDoubleLinkedList, contains an Element and a pointer to previous and next
ListTester.java - Performs the battery of tests on the IUDoubleLinkedList

Compilation:

This program is mostly based around ListTester.java, the other classes really meant to be implemented in other programs.
To run this program in console compile ListTester.java like such

javac ListTester.java

Then run the program

java ListTester

Make sure that all the files are in the same folder. The same process can be run in an IDE through the same means, by running
ListTester.java

As a note, each test is written the format Name of the list and the method being performed. For example:

AB_listIterPrevAddC_ACB_testContainsC 

The starting list is AB with a list iterator calling previous add C resulting in ACB, and then runs the method of whether it contains C.
