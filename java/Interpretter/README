Overview:

A brief run down of the program. Implemented the ability to read in and write out values
in this version. Whenever anything is evaluated the output is not printed to console. 
Must use the wr command in order to do so. Implemented boolean expressions with
if then statements as well as if then else statements, as well as while do loops. In
order to run the test classes Interpreter must be compiled first. See written grammar
for full extent of functionality.
