# Examples of my code

In this respository you will find examples of some of the code that I have written through out my collegiate career. Some of this work has been done in groups, and some has been written solitarily. I have chosen to group the examples based on high level ideas. These categories include:

* Data Science: This code involves the analysis of Data, in terms of describing the Data, selecting features, and performing classification.
* Machine Learning: This code focuses on the writing of Machine Learning algorithms rather than the implementation of ML libraries.
* Operating Systems: Code in this section deals with low level code but also includes data structures designed to be employed at low levels as well.
* Theory Of Computation: This section contains code intended to parse grammars and handle automata. 
* Web Development: Websites that I have helped to create.
* Natural Language Processing: Code that focuses on handling and generating text.
